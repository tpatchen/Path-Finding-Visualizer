# Pathfinding-Visualizer

A simple pathfinding visualizer that visualizes the A* search algorithm and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

Instructions:
1. Run main.py
2. Choose a starting position by left clicking on a square.
3. Choose a ending position by left clicking on a square.
4. Click any other squares to set squares as a border that cannot be traversed.
5. Press 'B' over squares to set bombs that increase the weight of block to 5.
6. Right click over a square to reset it back to a normal square.
7. Press 'A' to run the A* search algorithm and 'D' to run Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

Requirements:
1. Pygame must be installed. Visit here for installation https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted
